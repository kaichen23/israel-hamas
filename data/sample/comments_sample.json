that's right! you turned it right around into some lame defence about gaza again. you took a fucking story about dead israeli children, and made it about gaza and how it was dehumanizing them......read that again, slowly..... that's all kinds of fucked up. before you pull your bullshit defense about gaza/hamas again, i want you to read these, go ahead and defend these. because these are true actual stories that were captured on social media from the point of view of hamas. \"at a playground, he wonders in arabic, \"where are the kids?\" the duo set fire to one house, shoot an encroaching dog, and shoot another old man through a darkened screen. they are parsimonious with their ammunition, and chillingly unhurried as they pick through the tidy vegetable gardens and open the latches of wooden fences.\" \"then the video gets grisly. other militants are busy mashing a dying man's face with their boots. another pair screams \"allahu akbar\" as they use a garden hoe to try to decapitate another man.\" \"in another house, a gunman sticks the muzzle of his rifle into a room inhabited by a family. it's a mash of colors. in one, a terrorist is standing on an israeli man's chest and shoots him point-blank in the face\" \"then, the scenes of bloodied bedrooms start to blur. the rooms and the gore are the same -- it's how the bodies are arrayed in death that's different. there are so many children. some are jam-packed together in a slippery mass of human flesh. huge blood stains streak the tiles.\" \"so many of the bodies are burnt. it was unclear if this was because they were set fire to or if it was from the grenade blasts. other videos show israeli first responders trying to put out the still-smoldering skeletal remains of victims -- with water bottles, as if watering a parched plant.\" \"in another video, a grenade was apparently tossed into one of the bomb shelters that line the roads in southern israel. it was filled with partygoers who'd left the supernova music festival. the camera shows a flash of limbs, some dismembered, some still attached to writhing, screaming bodies. a selfie camera shows a young man weeping, while someone croaks hoarsely in the background, \"help, help.\" hamas then drags survivors out, some by their hair, to trucks, and then batters them some more in the backs of the pickups on the way to gaza.\" \"forensic images show bodies burned in cars, on beds, on the streets and in the fields in various states of incineration.one video shows the sheer number of hamas attackers at the supernova festival. there's no way they hadn't planned to raid the party. those were some of the most professional and well-equipped fighters we saw in the video. some of them are wearing police uniforms, others are in military uniforms.\" >>40 children is terrible.btw i think current estimates over 1000 children are dead in israeli airstrikes.the story of beheading babies specifically is designed to dehumanize gazans to provide manufactured consent for the humanitarian crisis the idf is presiding over. going back to this post, you had no problem believing that the idf bombed the hospital, which hamas was the one to spread that disinformation, in fact your most recent post on it \"here's my hesitation: if it is clearly hamas why would the idf lie about it twice?...\" so when hamas spread their bullshit, you absolutely believed it was the idf and still do even after all the evidence has come out. btw i haven't noticed any evidence from hamas yet? isn't that odd? your expectations for the burder of proof? you believe hamas, but yet not the evidence the idf has presented. hell man, even al jeezera has changed their story. then you said this lovely piece to cap it all off. >either way, the expedient thing to do is wait until canada can independently confirm, given how serious the allegation is. part of the problem yesterday was people rushing to judgement without verification. so on one hand, the baby story is manufactured consent yet the hospital bombing story \"we need to wait for blah blah, but this is why i think the idf did it\" you say you're not a shill for hamas, but come on dude......if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck.....you claim \"genocide\" but ignore the fact that gaza has one of the fastest rising populations in the entire world, you claim that the last time an election was held most of those living in gaza were not alive as the average age is 18 in gaza. i noticed you forget to mention the reason for this is because the average women in gaza is having four children and since the early 2000s the population has been rapidly increasing. this is why the 18 year olds are the average age of gaza, weird genocide tactic by israel right?

without an international peacekeeping force there. there is a lot of mistrust and (founded) ressentment on both sides. like i said in another comment, people will need something akin to a truth comission or other transitional justice mechanism to sort this out and i do not envy those who will be called to compose it. over a century of fumbles, mistakes and tragedies to adress... whoever

people with a different perspective, peace and empthaty will never be achieved.i feel in a similar way.i few things that i want to point out though.>i personally know that posted awful stuff justifying the attack.i think this is mostly an issue of people being dumb/tone deaf and a lot of other people being (understandably) touchy about it. i read the letter of the collage kids and it was not as bad as it was reported in the media. it just put the ultimate blame for the tragedy on the israeli government. which is an analysis that has been mostly corroborated by the evidence. it does not excuse the attack thought.if the question is whether there are people that were glorifying the attack or trying to minimize it i agree there were many of these people. but 2 things about them is that they probably have this position because they have been fed misinformation but not because they just want dead israelis and there is also a lot of trauma connected to these responses also (similarly how the attack on israel reignited these the generational trauma of a lot of jews).>i don't see many condemn the hamas attacksi honestly see this as a meme now. what is the point of saying \"i condemn hamas/the attack!\"? it's to show you don't agree with the methods and motives behind it. if you say that innocent civilians, both israeli and palestinian, should not be killed is doing basically the same. or saying what hamas did was unforgivable or anything similar. people act as if you don't say the magic word \"condemn\" you don't think hamas is bad actually.>ahhh, i suppose we would disagree that israel is a aparthid state (fully agree the settlements are, but not the state). let's not mince words here, if you think in israel proper you have the same rights as an arab muslim as an white israeli is delusional. there are countless muslims that get jailed because they are not pro-israel enough. you know that it is illegal to teach about the nakba? or that supporting in any way a palestinian state can be viewed by the state as being anti-israel and thus get you jailed. just how jews and christians were not equals to muslims in the ottoman empire now arab muslims are second class citizens.you could even say that the turks were much more progressive (especially during the early ears of the empire) since the moment you convert you get to enjoy all the privileges of turks. that's why there are a lot of jokes in balkan subreddits about how actually all turks are actually muslim greeks and so on.>bro, i repeated the words that came of the hamas officials words and you're saying \"they don't reallllly mean it\". no, we don't disagree on whether they mean it. they definitely do. but much of what they do must be facilitated by bad policy. it's like leaving your front door open in a sketchy neighborhood, it is still the robbers decision to rob you but probably the insurance won't pay you because you also didn't do your part in protecting your property. i think that lion share of the blame should go to the long lasting israeli policy of occupation, apartheid and ethnic cleansing of palestinians, with the added incompetence of protecting your own people. hamas is ofcourse the perpetrator but they didn't came from nothing.>honestly, even if the \"jews\" that arrived in dagestan were israelis, i still don't think they should be attacked.that is my point. just how innocent civilians should not be killed in gaza or israel so everywhere else. this includes some random people traveling on a plane from tel aviv. even if they voted for bibi i don't think they should be killed (while i do think he must be tried under international court for the crimes of genocide, ethic cleansing and deliberate murder of civilians). what i don't like seeing in this sub is that a lot of people seem to be ok with the opposite and even justifying the civilian death toll in gaza with \"they should not have voted for hamas\" or \"they should have resisted hamas government more\" which i find vile and repugnant. >gaza is very densely populated. hamas , on purpose, puts their headquaters/ bomb under hospitals, near nurserys, mosques. they have selected many of the targets already. they are attempting to minimise civilian causalities.first they do not attempt to minimize civilian casualties. it has been clear from the rethoric of the israeli administrative that they aim to kill as much palestinian as possible. unless there is a hamas base under every building in the gaza city i don't understand why you should flatten the city with bombs.also i categorically reject the idea that if hamas has a base under a hospital you should bomb the hospital. there are to tiers to this believe of mine. 1: i morally object on the idea of attacks against civilians even if there are some military targets in their midst. 2: even if you don't belive that killing civilians is morally wrong you should be able to understand that killing civilians will only lead to more people getting radicalized by hamas or similar organizations.the point is that if you want me to be on israel's side you gotta show me that israel is better than hamas and the only think that i am hearing is \" hamas did a bad thing why can't israel do also a bad thing?\" like we are in some sick version of preschool where two children are fighting. idk dude, i feel

disagree with that, i do agree that often people make bad faith offers just to hurt the other side, but this is far from what op has suggest, and i think that everything she said can either be classified as obviously a positive step, or as debatable step, nothing in what she said seemed to be in bad faithher vision;* ignores the need for palestinian statehood/independence, yet still touches on palestinian 'limited autonomy', i.e the most she's apparently willing to go to is a specialized form of sham self-determination for palestinians.* supports curbing freedom of speech for statements/slogans relating to palestinians and pro-palestinians in the west.* abolishing unrwa (not bad on it's own, but when in context with the others it seems more like taking away the little benefits refugees do have without even a palestinian state to go back to)> outlaw genocidal slogans like \"from the river to the sea, palestine will be free\" - again, i don't think there is much to discuss here and just like the pay for slay, if you don't agree with it, than our morals are way too far apart to agree on anythingwhat's funny is that this statement is _objectively_ not a genocidal statement, regardless of how many people try to twist and turn it into a call for genocide, but even if it was a genocidal statement (which it isn't) i would still not want to criminalize saying it. i view the first amendment, for example, and free speech as almost sacred elements, that should not be curbed in order to punish a certain group of people for political purposes, but rather respected. if jews want to say 'free judea and samaria' or 'free israel from the river to the sea' it should not be criminalized. and no disagreeing with them isn't a sound basis to ban them. israel is already pretty much the only country you're not allowed to boycott/can be punished for boycotting, i don't see why we should make more exceptions for things that hurt the feelings of certain israelis or zionists at the expense of free speech.> i think that this is the only way, at least for now, children both gaza and the west bank had been studying with anti semitic books under heavy propaganda, and it is likely that there is no hope in de-radicalizing them, a solution to that is to give the palestinians partial autonomy for a few decades, in which israel will oversee their study material, and maybe after a few decades, we could transition from limited autonomy under israel, to a fully independent palestinian countrythere's no doubt there needs to be a provisional transformation period, op just talked about a limited palestinian autonomy, not an independent state. your reasoning can't be used to justify their position because this is a defeatist mentality with weak roots, i'm not sure how brainwashed you think palestinians, or rather palestinian children are are, but removing elements of extremism from palestinian society is not fundamentally hard, it just also needs palestinians to see that there are more than the two types of jews they only ever interact with, ultrareligious/ultranationalistic settlers and armed israeli authorities patrolling their localities. books aren't the only problem, antisemitism as a result of the ethnic conflict was a thing well prior to the whole textbook thing. self-determination is not a right countries or people get to 'take away' because 'textbooks'. this is a tactic present among the israeli right where they try to convince others that more settlements + annexation and opposition to palestinian statehood is the way because palestinians are essentially 'too far gone' instead of outright stating their irredentist ethnonationalist fantasies being the basis of their ideas. neither practically nor morally is defeatism of
