One country, one law, with real political power, and a secular government, living in a true democracy. Settlers would be removed, those who lost land would receive compensation, and those affected by the war would get compensation or social welfare. All these children would have a chance to live a normal life. As part of the condition, Israel would get renamed to something else. Every citizen would have equal rights, and stolen land would be returned to rightful owners. This way, Palestinians wouldn\u2019t lose any land or livelyhood, and there would be no more lives lost. No more wars. No more bloods sheds on both side. \n\nNow I genuinely see no other solution. Israelis aren\u2019t going away. Hamas isn\u2019t giving up either.

I'm making this post because I see some muslimahs downplaying the importance of hijab because of the sins of others. They say things like \"but I know hijabis who have boyfriend and non hijabis that don't\" or \"non hijabis who are very religious but hijabis who aren't\" \n\nThere are levels of practicing, what you might find easy another person might not so maybe a girl who isn't very religious found that putting on a hijab was easier than breaking up with her boyfriend, does that mean she is a representation of every hijabi? No, she's not. \n\nFor the non hijabis who say stuff like this, you don't understand the struggles of wearing the hijab. To walk into an interview and wonder \"will I get this job? What if they don't like that I wear hijab\" or walk around in public and wonder if someone is going to hurt you or say islamophobic things, to smile at someone only to be met with a frown. To get snide comments from family member about being very religious or that men will not find you attractive for marriage or get asked if you're bald underneath. Then after all of this you hear a girl who is also a Muslim and knows the importance of hijab, downplay it and make it seem like it doesn't matter whether you wear it or not. To be told the hijabis they knew were worst than non hijabis\n\nI'm assuming this mentality stems from guilt but it doesn't excuse this behavior. Yes hijab is not an indicator of religiosity but it is important and I'm sure if someone was an alcoholic these same people who downplay hijab wouldn't be supporting it and justifying it.\n\nDon't go around ruining the reputation of hijabis with these statements because of your experience with a few people in your town or uni", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "upvotes": 1}, {"subreddit": "india", "id": "172mirw", "author": "qcajo", "timestamp": "1696728036.0", "title": "Brazilian President Lula, in an interview with Al Jazeera, said he would help Palestine by sending weapons to Hamas. \"The U.S. is to blame for the war,\" the president said", "text": "", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "upvotes": 1}, {"subreddit": "exmuslim", "id": "17rgtxi", "author": "Tfsjpvt-Mjwjoh-7233", "timestamp": "1699547384.0", "title": "Someone had the guts to say it", "text": "", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "upvotes": 1}, {"subreddit": "NoFilterNews", "id": "16iqact", "author": "Gbdujpo_Dijfg", "timestamp": "1694716888.0", "title": "/r/worldnews - https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-09-14/police-arrest-argentinas-biggest-online-distributor-of-nazi-propaganda-and-literature.html", "text": "/r/worldnews\n   \n https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-09-14/police-arrest-argentinas-biggest-online-distributor-of-nazi-propaganda-and-literature.html", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "upvotes": 1}, {"subreddit": "DisneyNewsfeed", "id": "17h32ew", "author": "MjgfDsbdlfs", "timestamp": "1698344897.0", "title": "'It Erupted': Marvel Insider Exposes Secret Invasion's Behind-the-Scenes Drama", "text": "", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "upvotes": 1}, {"subreddit": "theworldnews", "id": "17te10j", "author": "xpsmeofxtcpu", "timestamp": "1699769150.0", "title": "30 years after illegal takeover, High Court orders settlers out of Palestinian land", "text": "", "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "upvotes": 29}, {"subreddit": "Muslim", "id": "15x3ft9", "author": "zpvtfg-bnfs", "timestamp": "1692612793.0", "title": "Surah Ya-Sin translated, Calming and tranquil Quran recitation || Tranquil Quran", "text": "", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "upvotes": 1}, {"subreddit": "MuslimLounge", "id": "16yireb", "author": "Mjuumfnjttjel", "timestamp": "1696308228.0", "title": "How to cut things off", "text": "Hello I\u2019m on the search for a spouse and I met those cool guy vs muzz and we been talking.

During the First World War, as the Ottomon Empire weakened, the United Kingdom occupied Palestine.\n\n\u200eIn 1917, the British Foreign Secretary, in a letter to Lionel Rothschild, declared his full support for the formation of a Jewish state in the Palestinian territories. We call it \u201ca promise from someone who has nothing to someone who doesn't deserve it\u201d.\n\n\u200eAt the beginning of the implementation of this fateful promise, the number of Jews in Palestine was 7%. After the immigration of European Jews to the British protectorate, the total Jewish population in Palestine grew to 28%.\n\n\u200eAfter World War II, the UN issued a resolution for the partition of Palestine between Arabs and Jews in 1947.\n\n\u200eOn May 14, 1948, Israeli leaders met at the Tel Aviv museum and announced the end of the British occupation of Palestine and the establishment of the state of Israel, recognized by the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\n\u200eThe 1948 war:\n\u200eMany Arab countries rejected the unjust occupation of Palestine and its division by the United States. After successive wars with US support, Israel occupied larger areas than those initially envisaged by the United States.\n\n\u200eMany Palestinian organizations, armed and unarmed, fought together for the liberation of their state, which was unjustly divided and occupied.\n\n\u200eViolations against Palestinians are committed daily and systematically. There are more than 100 thousand registered martyrs, twice that number has not been counted and there are more than a million dead.\n\n\u200eViolations are carried out in various aspects of life, including education, health, supplies that are constantly cut off, violations of religious sanctities and provocations on Palestinian commemorative dates and holidays.\n\n\u200eIsrael does not intend to give the Palestinians peace, and does not want a Palestinian state to be established near \u201cits\u201d lands. The Palestinian area is shrinking daily while territories controlled by Israel are expanding.\n\n\u200eGoogle the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrahm and you will see Palestinian violations and Israeli occupations. The Palestinian reaction is just a reaction to daily violations, which are not reported as much as they should be.\n\n\u200eIf you are a free person, you will certainly not accept all this hypocrisy and distortion of facts by the international community.

If you are suicidal or are dealing with a mental illness, remember that you're not alone. It's ok to ask for help. Everything's gonna be ok.\n\nSo, I thought I would share my story. (You're gonna understand why islam is related)\n\nIt all started when I was 12 years old. I was growing up and my body was changing. That's why my parents started criticising my body and started to tell me to cover up. They started restricting my life. I couldn't do so many things just because I'm a girl. I couldn't go outside alone. I couldn't play sports. I felt like a prisoner. I felt trapped in my own body. I felt like being a girl was a curse. \n\nAt the age of 13 my world changed and opened up. I moved to a different country (west). I met non Muslims and I started questioning islam. But I didn't have the courage to speak up. I couldn't understand why my non muslim friends would go to hell, just because they didn't believe in Islam. 13 was pretty rough. I started self harming to deal with my problems. \n\nAt the age of 14, I left islam. I finally understood what its like to be free. I was suicidal and my mental health was worse because I was sick of pretending to be a Muslim. I was self harming pretty much every single day.\n\nNow I'm 15. I was inpatient and I attempted suicide twice because of Islam. I attempted to escape. I attempted because I was sick of pretending to be someone I'm not. I attempted because of my super religious family members.\nNow, I'm better. Things are not better now, but I'm stronger. I'm 4 months self harm free. I left islam a year ago, but I still carry its burden. I still feel suicidal because of Islam.\n\nThanks for reading my story.

Older people who still get their news from mainstream media/cable news (cnn, fox etc.) are more likely to be pro-israel since the mainstream media is biased and pushes Israel propoganda. However, the younger generation which has access to social media and other news outlets are much less likely to be pro-israel. Pro-israel people blame TikTok, but the reality is, TikTok algorithm only pushes stuff you are interested in. More people are pro-Palestinian amongst the younger generation.\n\n And of course world wide, israel isn\u2019t popular. All the Muslims (2 billion) of course support Palestine by default. But a lot of African and South American countries seem to also be pro-Palestinian as well as many European countries. The main backer of Israel seems to be US and UK. Even France has become hesitant after seeing what Israel has done in Gaza.\n\nLastly, anyone who has brain and doesn\u2019t believe in the IDF lies, knows their intention is ethnic cleansing. The lies (beheaded babies, rape etc) are all used to justify genocide. Israel lied about 1500 ppl killed. And btw a lot of those were idf soldiers. The music people were caught in between fire from hamas and idf. Does anyone really believe hamas has machines to completely burn cars? The people who believe this are the same ones who believed Iraq had WMDs. Hamas has a better record historically then IDF when it comes to lies. A lot of their leaders have practically called for a genocide. Bibi quoted amalek from the Bible where their god commands the Israelites to kill men, women and children. Now imagine if Hamas said that? \n\nIsrael uses the same talking points about human shields and \u201cright to defend\u201d, but I think everyone is awake now. Hamas killed less civilians intentionally then IDF. Hamas main goal is a hostage swap. Why don\u2019t the pro_israelis call for a release of Palestinian children hostages? Even oct 7 attack about half were soldiers. Israel has killed over 90% civilians. They are targeting civilians not hamas. 40k residential building destroyed. Hamas in underground. Btw Gaza is 25 miles so no matter where hamas operates there will be civilians. So the human shield argument is dumb. Imagine if there was a school shooter and to get him you bomb the whole school. They want to make sure gazans have nothing to come back to. Btw u can\u2019t defeat an ideology. They know that. These people will rightfully hate Israel. That\u2019s why they want to push them into Egypt. Why is IDF and settler terrorism in the West Bank allowed? Can\u2019t blame hamas. Palestinian have protested peacefully and IDF has constantly killed unarmed civilians. Why isn\u2019t that terrorism? Why don\u2019t Palestinians have a right to defend? Why is that terrorism?  Palestinians have a right to resist IDF terrorism and occupation", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "upvotes": 1}, {"subreddit": "brasilnoticias", "id": "17b3dya", "author": "xjmmjbncpuufs", "timestamp": "1697668347.0", "title": "Assembleia de Rond\u00f4nia concede t\u00edtulo de cidad\u00e3o honor\u00e1rio a Binyamin Netanyahu", "text": "", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "upvotes": 1}, {"subreddit": "islam", "id": "186gq84", "author": "blnbmlvo", "timestamp": "1701231724.0", "title": "Muslim speed dating event by Muzz", "text": "What do you think about this event held recently by Muzz Muslim Dating app?
